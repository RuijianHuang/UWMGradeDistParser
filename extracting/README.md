# Parsing

Parsing and extracting meaningful data is tricky for a number of reasons:

1. The data is distributed as PDF's.
2. Some data is omitted due to privacy concerns.
3. Schools have many departments, departments have many courses, courses have many sections, sections have different section types, etc. Each term has different courses offered. Organization is difficult to keep track of, but is key.

Luckily, all the DIR files are in the same format, as are all the GPA distribution files. They haven't updated how the table appears, for example. The same process can be applied to every single term.

### Unknowns as of now:

* Can course names be changed from year to year, while retaining their course number? (i.e. Math 222 changes from Calc 2 to Calculus II)
* Can course numbers be repurposed? (i.e. Math 222 changes from Calc 2 to Probability Theory)

### Notes

* [DIR 1124](https://registrar.wiscweb.wisc.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/36/2017/06/1124_Final_DIR.pdf) is different than every other DIR.
